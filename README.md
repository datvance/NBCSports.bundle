NBCSports.bundle
================

A very basic Plex Channel plug-in to view the highlight videos on NBCSports.com, including Premier League, NFL, etc.

It doesn't (and won't) do LiveExtra streaming, which Plex does not support.

Channel tested and working on Plex/Web, Roku and PHT on OSX. Haven't tested any other clients.
